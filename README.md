# IncendoChat

**Work in progress!** 

Very simple channel based chat plugin. Will support the following features:
- Joinable channels, with permissions, and an API that allows you to add custom restrictions
- Chat formatting, supporting vault and PlaceholderAPI 
- JSON message formatting. Click to message a channel, click to message a player, etc. 
- @player ping notifications
- API to interact with chat players, channels, etc, plus events for: channel join,
 channel leave, channel creation and channel messages
- (Optional) chat logging

Other features may be added further on.

This plugin will not:
- Handle mutes, punishments, etc. Use a punishment plugin for this.
- Handle swear blocking, spam blocking etc. I recommend [ChatControl](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatcontrolâ„¢-the-ultimate-chat-plugin-500-000-downloads-1-2-5-1-15-2.271/)
and [ChatEx](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/chatex) for this functionality. IncendoChat
is compatible with plugins such as these, that alter chat messages, and will respect
their rules.

## Requirements
- You need to have [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) installed.
- You need to run (at least) Java 8.
- The plugin is built for Spigot 1.15+. It may work with earlier versions, but they're entirely unsupported.

## Commands
- **/ch help** - Display the help text (Permission: `incendochat.channel`)
- **/ch join \<channel\>** - Join a channel (Permission: `incendochat.channel.join`)
- **/ch leave \<channel\>** - Leave a channel (Permission: `incendochat.channel.leave`)
- **/ch set \<channel\>** - Make the channel your active channel (Permission: `incendochat.channel.set`)
- **/ch send \<channel\> \<msg...\>** - Send a message to a channel you're in (Permission: `incendochat.channel.send`)
- **/ch list** - List all channels (Permission: `incendochat.channel.list`)
